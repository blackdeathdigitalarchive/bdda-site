	    <p>In the past decade, the BDDA project participants have pioneered new approaches to the history of plague during the Second Plague Pandemic, the 500-year period in which new strains of plague spread throughout most of the Old World. This “new paradigm” in plague studies has readily adopted the evolutionary perspective on the history of Yersinia pestis as a pathogenic organism as put forward by biologists working from both phylogenetic (evolutionary) and palaeogenetic (aDNA retrieval) perspectives. As a result, instead of the “plague” functioning as a generic term for any kind of epidemic disease, or even a sustained catastrophic event (e.g., the ten Biblical “Plagues of Egypt”), plague—the disease caused by the bacterium Y. pestis— has become a biologically verifiable and a distinct entity in human history. </p>

	    <p>The plague can now be tracked with precision through space and time, allowing us to create a narrative of the pathogen’s effects on specific societies such as Bronze Age Eurasia, the late medieval Mongol Empire, early modern East Africa and India, and the modern American West.</p>
	    <p>The history of the micro-organism, however, only tells one part of the overall story. The rest must be told by bringing the biology into dialogue with what can be learned from documentary and archaeological sources about the actual causes of epidemic and pandemic events, and the effects of such phenomena on human populations. Over the last decade, our team members have implemented this new approach to plague history in their scholarship. BDDA is a natural outgrowth of our joint efforts to make this new paradigm accessible to a larger community.</p>

	    <p>Initial discussions about the BDDA first started in 2018 …… </p>
    
	    <p>Following initial discussions in 2018 BBDA officially launched in April 2019 during a two-day exploratory seminar (“Biraben 2.0: A Black Death Digital Archive”) organized by Monica H. Green and Joris Roosen at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study to discuss the basic structure of the BDDA project. The participants:…</p>

	    <p>In summer 2019, Nükhet Varlık started to organize the collection of data from the Ottoman archives with the help of BDDA project assistant Mesut Sayan and supported by a five-year SSHRC Insight Grant for “Rewriting Plague’s Second Pandemic: History Meets Science.” Nükhet Varlık, Ece Turnator, and Mesut Sayan (in consultation with DH consultants/Pelagios/Jamie Folsom of Performant Software) developed the basic organization of data using AirTable.</p>

	    <p> In Fall 2020, Monica Green, Nükhet Varlık, and Tunahan Durmaz received a “Covid-19 Grant for History in the Public Interest from Villanova University Albert Lepage Center for History in the Public Interest for the project “Reconceiving the History of Plague in the Era of COVID-19.” This project aims to collate and categorize translations of sources on infectious diseases in the Islamicate World. This grant helped lay out the structure for the organization of the History of Infectious Disease in the Islamicate World Working Group (HIDIW), hosted by the Consortium for History of Science, Technology, and Medicine (CHSTM). HIDIW Working Group meets once a month to discuss sources on the infectious diseases in the Islamicate World.</p>

<p>BDDA was awarded a special commendation by the CARMEN Medieval Network for its promise as an innovative digital project. The judges were impressed with the cross-national reach of the project (both in terms of the research team itself as well as the global reach of their work), its potential to advance scholarly and public understanding of the second plague pandemic through the creation of a multidisciplinary web portal, and its exciting integration of Medieval Studies with the burgeoning field of the Medical Humanities. (For the announcement of award, see https://arc-humanities.org/carmen/project-prize.)</p>
 
<p>BDDA is a partner of the Pelagios Network, a research community that “connects researchers, scientists and curators to link and explore the history of places,” organized by experts dedicated to advancing the use of digital technologies in the humanities. One of the areas Pelagios assumes a leadership role is in Linked Open Data (LOD); it offers a set of tools through its various platforms to register, visualize, and annotate linked data. </p>
