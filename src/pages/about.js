  <p>In the past decade, the BDDA project participants have pioneered
    new approaches to the history of plague during the Second Plague
    Pandemic, the 500-year period in which new strains of plague
    spread throughout most of the Old World. This “new paradigm” in
    plague studies has readily adopted the evolutionary perspective on
    the history of <i>Yersinia pestis</i> as a pathogenic organism as
    put forward by biologists working from both phylogenetic
    (evolutionary) and palaeogenetic (aDNA retrieval) perspectives. As
    a result, instead of the “plague” functioning as a generic term
    for any kind of epidemic disease, or even a sustained catastrophic
    event (e.g., the ten Biblical “Plagues of Egypt”), plague—the
    disease caused by the bacterium Y. pestis— has become a
    biologically verifiable and a distinct entity in human
    history. </p>

	    <p>The plague can now be tracked with precision through
	    space and time, allowing us to create a narrative of the
	    pathogen’s effects on specific societies such as Bronze
	    Age Eurasia, the late medieval Mongol Empire, early modern
	    East Africa and India, and the modern American West.</p>

	    <p>The history of the micro-organism, however, only tells
	    one part of the overall story. The rest must be told by
	    bringing the biology into dialogue with what can be
	    learned from documentary and archaeological sources about
	    the actual causes of epidemic and pandemic events, and the
	    effects of such phenomena on human populations. Over the
	    last decade, our team members have implemented this new
	    approach to plague history in their scholarship. BDDA is a
	    natural outgrowth of our joint efforts to make this new
	    paradigm accessible to a larger community.</p>
