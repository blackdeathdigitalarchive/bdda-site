	    <p>Following initial discussions in 2018 BBDA officially launched
	    in April 2019 during a two-day exploratory seminar (“Biraben 2.0: A
	    Black Death Digital Archive”) organized by Monica H. Green and
	    Joris Roosen at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study to
	    discuss the basic structure of the BDDA project.</p>

	    <p>In summer 2019, Nükhet Varlık started to organize the collection
	    of data from the Ottoman archives with the help of BDDA project
	    assistant Mesut Sayan and supported by a five-year SSHRC Insight
	    Grant for “Rewriting Plague’s Second Pandemic: History Meets
	    Science.” Nükhet Varlık, Ece Turnator, and Mesut Sayan (in
	    consultation with DH consultants/Pelagios/Jamie Folsom of
	    Performant Software) developed the basic organization of data using
	    AirTable.</p>

	    <p> In Fall 2020, Monica Green, Nükhet Varlık, and Tunahan Durmaz
	    received a &ldquo;Covid-19 Grant for History in the Public Interest&rdquo; from
	    Villanova University Albert Lepage Center for History in the Public
	    Interest for the project “Reconceiving the History of Plague in the
	    Era of COVID-19.” This project aims to collate and categorize
	    translations of sources on infectious diseases in the Islamicate
	    World. This grant helped lay out the structure for the organization
	    of the History of Infectious Disease in the Islamicate World
	    Working Group (HIDIW), hosted by the Consortium for History of
	    Science, Technology, and Medicine (CHSTM). HIDIW Working Group
	    meets once a month to discuss sources on the infectious diseases in
	    the Islamicate World.</p>

	    <p> In Spring 2021, the BDDA partnered with AGILE Humanities for
	    web development, supported by the University of South Carolina,
	    College of Arts and Sciences …</p>
 
	    <p>Black Death Digital Archive is supported by:</p>

	    </ul>
      
	    <p>BDDA was awarded a special commendation by the CARMEN Medieval
	    Network for its promise as an innovative digital project. The
	    judges were impressed with the cross-national reach of the project
	    (both in terms of the research team itself as well as the global
	    reach of their work), its potential to advance scholarly and public
	    understanding of the second plague pandemic through the creation of
	    a multidisciplinary web portal, and its exciting integration of
	    Medieval Studies with the burgeoning field of the Medical
	    Humanities. (For the announcement of award, see

	    <p>BDDA is a partner of the Pelagios Network, a research community
	    that “connects researchers, scientists and curators to link and
	    explore the history of places,” organized by experts dedicated to
	    advancing the use of digital technologies in the humanities. One of
	    the areas Pelagios assumes a leadership role is in Linked Open Data
	    (LOD); it offers a set of tools through its various platforms to
	    register, visualize, and annotate linked data. </p>
