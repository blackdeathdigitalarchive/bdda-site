title: About the BDDA
---

In the past decade, the BDDA project participants have pioneered
    new approaches to the history of plague during the Second Plague
    Pandemic, the 500-year period in which new strains of plague
    spread throughout most of the Old World. This “new paradigm” in
    plague studies has readily adopted the evolutionary perspective on
    the history of <i>Yersinia pestis</i> as a pathogenic organism as
    put forward by biologists working from both phylogenetic
    (evolutionary) and palaeogenetic (aDNA retrieval) perspectives. As
    a result, instead of the “plague” functioning as a generic term
    for any kind of epidemic disease, or even a sustained catastrophic
    event (e.g., the ten Biblical “Plagues of Egypt”), plague—the
    disease caused by the bacterium Y. pestis— has become a
    biologically verifiable and a distinct entity in human
    history.
